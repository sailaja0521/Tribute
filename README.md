# Tribute
This is my first project to demonstrate my foundational skills in HTML and CSS. The page is  created to showcase my ability to build responsive, user-friendly websites.
 And this project was developed as part of my journey to learn web development and improve my skills with HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a simple yet functional tribute page, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed experimenting with styling techniques and layout designs.
Technologies Used:
HTML
